# overview of code
This code describes and models the current coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic in the state of Idaho.

It models the pandemic in Idaho as kinetic function of time in days, with WORDS WORDS WORDS modeling uninfected, infected, recovered, and deaths???

## Tell us a little bit about the idaho_infections.csv file and what it holds
And maybe tell us a little bit about how we might compare our plots from kinetics.py with it.

The idaho_infections.csv file includes the number of infected people in Idaho and the number of days since the first recorded infection. 

# software requirements
This code requires access to a commandline terminal and to have a github account to access the p2-kinetics repository and to be able to track and collaborate with other researchers on
this topic. For this program to run python must be installed on the local machine.To download Python go to terminal, type in the command line "apt-get install python". This will start 
downloading Python onto the local machine. It will ask a few permission questions and you will have to let it install Python onto the local machine.


# how to get this code
The run the code on your computer, pull the p2-kinetics repository from github class master to your terminal, or fork the repository and pull the code from your own personal repository. 

# how to use this code
To use this code you must be in the directory that contains the code. Type "python kinetics.pyi " + the path to the file that contains the data.
This code can be run in the commandline terminal by typing "$ python [FILE NAME]" here.
